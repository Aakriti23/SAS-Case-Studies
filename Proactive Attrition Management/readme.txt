Proactive Attrition Management


This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting customer churn at “Cell2Cell,” a fictitious wireless telecom company, and use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan for enticing would-be churners to remain with Cell2Cell. 
 
Data for the case are available in csv format. The data are a scaled down version of the full database generously donated by an anonymous wireless telephone company. There are still 71,047 customers in the database, and 75 potential predictors. Trainees can use whatever method they wish to develop their predictive model.
